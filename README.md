# PDF Rotateur

Written in C# and taking advantage of *iTextSharp* & *PdfiumViewer*, this tool might help to export a PDF file with pages rotated by 90, 180 or 270 degrees, based on user's choice.

The tool used *iTextSharp* to rotate the pages, and *PdfiumViewer* to help its user preview and save the PDF file before and after rotation of the pages.

Currently, there are 3 supported languages: English, French & Vietnamese.

We would like to thank the authors of *iTextSharp* and *PdfiumViewer* for the creation of these wonderful libraries, and we hope that the tool will be useful to anyone needing help in rotating pages of a PDF file.
