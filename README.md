# PDF Rotateur

Written in C# and taking advantage of *iTextSharp* & *PdfiumViewer*, this tool might help to export a PDF file with pages rotated by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees, based on user's choice.

The tool used *iTextSharp* to rotate the pages, and *PdfiumViewer* to help its user preview and save the PDF file before and after rotation of the pages.

Currently, the tool runs on .NET Framework 4.5.2 and is available in 3 different interface languages: English, French & Vietnamese.

Some parts of this tool might have not been fully optimized yet due to my low level. Therefore, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you might experience while viewing or using the tool. I would also like to thank the authors of *iTextSharp* and *PdfiumViewer* for the creation of these wonderful libraries, and I hope that the tool will be useful to anyone needing help in rotating pages of a PDF file in the future.
